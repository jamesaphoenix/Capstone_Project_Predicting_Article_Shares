Simply download one of the following free apps to your phone (if an Android user, you may already have Google Maps).\\nWhile the apps won\\'t have the bells and whistles of a traditional sat-nav, crucially, you won\\'t have to use any data when overseas.\\nDownload the apps and maps before you go and then they\\'re stored offline in your phone – the apps use your phone\\'s built-in GPS to locate you and you don\\'t need data or Wi-Fi.\\nHere are our three top-pick sat-nav apps – all free to download and use:\\nGoogle Maps works offline too – so download before you go:\\xa0The\\xa0Google Maps\\xa0app (for iPhone and Android) is easy to use, and includes restaurants and reviews. You can use it offline, as long as you download maps in advance. It also offers real-time traffic and train info, though for that you\\'ll need a Wi-Fi or data connection.\\nHow to download Google Maps to use offline\\nSearch for the area you want.\\nTap the three horizontal lines in the top left of the screen, then select \\'Offline areas\\'.\\nIt\\'ll give you the option to select a \\'local\\' or \\'home\\', or a \\'custom area\\'. \\'Local\\' or \\'home\\' selects an area surrounding where your search is – \\'custom\\' lets you specify an area.\\nThe maps you\\'ve downloaded are stored in the \\'offline areas\\' section.\\nGreat for driving and country-by-country apps:\\xa0Navmii\\xa0is free for\\xa0iPhone,\\xa0 Android,\\xa0Blackberry\\xa0and\\xa0Windows Phone\\xa0(though the Blackberry and Windows Phone apps are no longer being updated). It comes with pre-loaded maps, route planning, voice prompts, mileage tracking and real-time hazard reporting.\\nNavmii has maps for 185+ countries, including the UK – to find them, search in your phone\\'s app store for Navmii plus the country, eg, \\'Navmii France\\'. If you prefer, you can download a worldwide app to cover the lot.\\nTop for detail including hiking trails and ATMs:\\xa0Maps.Me\\xa0allows users to add data to maps – such as places of interest or trails, for example. It works in a similar way to Wikipedia with users making contributions, which is why its maps are so detailed. It also includes islands in addition to whole countries – great if you\\'re going off the beaten track. It\\'s available for\\xa0iPhone\\xa0and\\xa0Android.\\nBy contrast, sat-nav maker TomTom has an iPhone\\xa0app with offline maps that offers a seven-day free trial (£1.99/month or £4.99/three months after) or a 30-day free trial (after that £8.99/six months).\\nUse the right cheap flight-finding site\\nDon\\'t go direct to an airline – use the price comparison sites below to get lots of data in a very short time.\\nKayak for a comparison incl baggage fees. Kayak*\\xa0lets you filter flights by baggage allowance, so you can compare costs more accurately.\\nSkyscanner for the very cheapest time to fly.\\xa0Skyscanner*\\xa0gives you fare options spread over a month to find exactly when\\'s cheapest. It has particularly strong coverage of budget flights, searching over 1,200 airlines and travel sites in total.\\nMomondo for its flight data info.\\xa0We like\\xa0Momondo*\\xa0for its nifty tool that tells you the cheapest and most expensive dates around your flight, as well as helpful insights such as the cheapest airport to fly from/into. It doesn\\'t do it for all destinations, but it has the biggies – New York, Dubai, Sydney, Cape Town.\\nSee the\\xa0Cheap Flights\\xa0guide for more tips on finding cheap flights.\\nDownload the free Citymapper app to navigate like a local\\nNavigating public transport in an unfamiliar city can be daunting. But don\\'t be tempted to automatically fork out for cabs\\xa0– the free Citymapper app\\xa0will have you hopping on and off the metro or subway like a true Parisian, New Yorker etc.\\nYou can use it in\\xa039 cities around the world, including London, Barcelona and Hong Kong. It\\'s available for iPhone and Android, or you can use the web app.\\nHow does it work?\\nThe \\'Get me somewhere\\' function is easy to use\\xa0– enter your destination and starting point to find the best route from A to B. It finds various public transport options, including bus-only, rain safe\\xa0– for routes that minimise travel outdoors – and wheelchair accessible. Not only that, it will show you how long it would take to walk, cycle or take a cab.\\nThe app covers a number of public transport options, which will naturally vary depending on the city you\\'re in. These include bus, metro/subway, rail, tram and cycle docks. You can also use it to view transport maps, such as bus routes.\\nHow to use the app offline\\nWhile it\\'s a handy app to use abroad, make sure you don\\'t\\xa0rack up big data charges. Unless you\\'re able to use your data for free, it\\'s best to switch off mobile data and use Wi-Fi to plan your route (eg, at your hotel or a café). You can then\\xa0save your journey offline\\xa0using the star in the top right of the screen.\\nWhen is the best time to book your holiday?\\nAlthough it\\'s not cut and dried, booking a whole year ahead can be MoneySaving.\\nBooking packages early can net special deals.\\xa0Tour operators can offer discounts for booking way ahead, eg, Tui, First Choice and Jet2holidays offer free child places if you book early. However, waiting till the last minute can also pay off as prices often plummet, though you\\'ve MUCH less choice. See\\xa0Cheap Package Holidays.\\nBook flights a year ahead.\\xa0Many airlines release seats 11-12 months ahead, with cheaper seats often released early. Although you can\\'t be sure these will be the very cheapest, as prices could drop later, you\\'ll likely at least get a decent price if you book as soon as all airlines on that route make seats available. See\\xa0Airline-by-airline seat release dates\\xa0and our\\xa0Cheap Flights\\xa0guide.\\nManipulate hotel prices with our rebook tricks.\\xa0Rates fluctuate but if you find a good deal on a room with free cancellation then grab it, monitor prices and cancel and rebook if it drops. Meanwhile, some booking sites match prices if they fall later. Both strategies can pay off but have their risks – see\\xa0Hotel rebook tricks.\\nGet travel insurance as soon as you book.\\xa0ALWAYS get travel insurance immediately. It doesn\\'t cost any more to get a policy early, and you\\'re then covered if you have to cancel any time BEFORE your holiday begins. See\\xa0Cheap Travel Insurance.\\nThe codeshare trick: where two airlines sell the same flight\\nIf you like flying with a specific airline or know the exact flight you want, \\'codesharing\\' could be a way to get a flight with that airline, via another one. It\\'s when airlines buddy up to sell seats on each others\\' flights, sometimes at a different price.\\nFor example, when we looked in March, we found a Virgin Atlantic return flight from London to Las Vegas in September for\\xa0£881, booking via Virgin Atlantic. But exactly the same flights booked via its partner Delta cost £816, saving £65.\\nThis works best on popular medium or long-haul routes. For a full \\'how to\\' and list of codeshare partners see the\\xa0Cheap Flights\\xa0guide.\\nBeat price hikes with Easyjet\\'s Flexifares\\nWe\\'ve found a clever way to bag cheaper flights using Easyjet\\'s \\'Flexifares\\', which let you switch dates by a few weeks without paying anything extra.\\nIt only works with \\'Flexifare\\' tickets, but once you\\'ve booked you can switch dates by a few weeks without paying more. It works the whole year round – but it\\'s particularly useful when prices shoot up during the school holidays. This means you can bag a cheap term-time flight, then swap for your chosen school holiday dates.\\nFull details and more tricks to flying with the orange-loving airline in\\xa0Easyjet Flexifare Trick.\\nMany airlines let you take child car seats and buggies for free\\nWhether you\\'re hiring a car or making a quick dash to the airport in a taxi – then if you\\'ve young children with you, they should be in a car seat.\\nRenting one can be pricey though. It can add around £5/day to the cost of hiring a car, and hike taxi fares sharply too – for example, we were quoted an extra €12 for a one-way journey from Barcelona airport to the city centre.\\nThere are alternative options – for instance, some airports have stalls like Malaga\\'s\\xa0Tots Store\\xa0where seats can be rented at half the cost. But your best bet may be to take your own.\\nMany airlines let you check in a car seat and fully-collapsible pushchair for free, in addition to your usual luggage allowance. Eg, Easyjet lets you take two items for free, including travel cots, buggies and car seats. The rules can, however, vary by airline.\\nIt\\'s worth noting some car seats can also be used on the plane (if you\\'ve paid for your child to have their own seat). The car seat\\'ll have to meet certain criteria though and it depends on the plane you\\'re travelling on, so check in advance.\\nEthnic travel agents may be cheaper\\nThe UK\\'s a melting pot of different immigrant and ethnic communities, and this can be used to great advantage for a cheap flight booking. Niche travel agents often specialise in finding deals to the relevant communities\\' linked countries.\\nFor example, Shepherd\\'s Bush in London and the surrounding area has some Caribbean specialist tour agents, or buy the\\xa0Jewish Chronicle, which has firms advertising cheap flights to Israel.\\nDon\\'t forget to check prices elsewhere before you buy, to make sure you\\'re getting a good deal. If you know of a cheap specialist travel agent, please\\xa0let us know in the forum.\\nGrab cheap or FREE access to airport lounges\\nAirport lounges aren\\'t just reserved for first class, business class or elite frequent flyers. Access can be free with certain credit cards or bank accounts, or you can get it cheaply via frequent flyer schemes such as Virgin Atlantic\\'s Flying Club.\\nOne-off passes start from around £20 per person. Given you could pay that for food and drinks alone at the airport, it can be good value, especially when you usually get a comfy seat in peace, and a newspaper or magazine thrown in too.\\nOur\\xa0Free or Cheap Airport Lounges\\xa0guide has top tips, including the credit card that\\'ll get you two free visits to 350+ lounges.\\nFREE app to help you talk like a local\\nYou can learn 34 languages completely free via language-learning app and website\\xa0Duolingo. It has all the standards such as French, Spanish and Italian – but there\\'s even \\'High Valyrian\\' and \\'Klingon\\' for\\xa0Game of Thrones\\xa0and\\xa0Star Trek\\xa0fans.\\nHow does it work?\\nThe app\\'s available for iPhone, Android and Windows phones. It\\'s free to download but there are optional in-app purchases. You can also learn via Duolingo\\'s website.\\nYou can set yourself goals of practising for five to 20 minutes each day, and it tries to make learning fun by turning each lesson into a game (eg, you lose lives when you get questions wrong).\\nYou can also join \\'clubs\\' where the app matches you up with other learners, so you can chat to each other and practise what you\\'ve learned. Forumite\\xa0Hermia\\xa0has been learning French via the app:\\nI love it. I honestly have learned more from the app than I have from three years of classes at school!\\nHow to find FREE water at airports for your flight – and avoid rip-off prices after security\\nRestrictions on taking liquids in hand luggage mean passengers often shell out for pricey bottles of water once in the departure lounge, or on the plane.\\nBut many airports have water fountains after security where you can fill up an empty water bottle or Thermos flask for free – you just have to know where to find \\'em.\\nTo help, we\\'ve compiled a handy guide to exactly where you can find free drinking fountains at 18 of the UK\\'s biggest airports. Simply take an empty bottle with you through security – the Civil Aviation Authority has confirmed\\xa0this IS allowed\\xa0– and fill it up before getting on the plane.\\nWhere to find free water fountains - airport by airport:\\nHeathrow\\nIt\\'s the biggest airport in the UK – and one of the best when it comes to free drinking water.

So make a point and politely decline showing them your pass unless they do.\\nThankfully as this campaign has been running a couple of years, it’s already started to have an impact.

But if you\\'re going away specifically for seven, 10 or 14 days to a traditional holiday destination, then good old-fashioned package holidays can often come up trumps.\\nA package holiday is an all-in-one, where the tour operator provides flights, connections and accommodation for one price. They\\'re best suited for standard breaks of standard length. So if it\\'s a traditional holiday destination like Florida or Crete, it\\'s worth checking to see if you can get a package for less than the DIY route.\\nWhen to book.\\xa0Massive savings are possible in the late market, which are deals done within eight weeks of travel, yet of course there\\'s restricted choice & you may need to be flexible. So if you need special facilities (eg, for families) you\\'re going to have to book now and try to cut prices down.\\nHow to cut prices.\\xa0Tour operators\\xa0make\\xa0holidays while travel agents\\xa0sell \\'em. Therefore, many big tour operators\\' holidays are sold by multiple agents. If you\\'re booking one, once you\\'ve found a specific deal, try calling up different agents and getting your haggle on to see if they can beat the price. You could save around 5% more. See\\xa0Cheap Package Holidays.\\nPackage holidays also usually have added\\xa0ATOL\\xa0and\\xa0ABTA\\xa0consumer protection (though always check when you book).\\nGet ATOL protection by booking flights + hotel or car hire\\nPackage holidays have long been protected under the\\xa0ATOL\\xa0scheme, so if something goes wrong you get your money back or help getting home.\\nFor bookings made since 1 July 2018, most DIY package holidays bought in the same transaction get the same cover as \\'traditional\\' package holidays - ie, full\\xa0financial\\xa0protection (so you\\'re entitled to a refund or be brought home if necessary if the firm organising your package goes bust) AND\\xa0legal\\xa0protection (so you\\'re covered if you don\\'t get the holiday you paid for, eg, if a supplier like an airline goes bust, or if bad weather stops you travelling).\\nFor more info, including the rules if you booked before 1 July 2018 and what protection other types of holiday offer, see\\xa0Holiday Rights.\\nOnce you\\'ve booked your trip you\\'ll get an ATOL certificate – keep it safe as you\\'ll need it if anything goes wrong.\\nDress kids in bright colours to stop you losing \\'em at the airport\\nIf you have kids (or you\\'ve ever seen\\xa0Home Alone), you\\'ll know what a nightmare it is to keep an eye on them in crowded places – especially if you\\'re hurrying to catch a plane or transfer. So one way to keep tabs on the tiddlers is to dress them so they\\'ll stick out like a sore thumb.\\nEx-MSE Andrea uses this trick every time she goes away with her family.\\nI pop my kids in bright coloured hats or clothes with spots on so they stand out when we\\'re travelling. We also take a photo of them on our phones in what they\\'re wearing before they leave. If they get lost, we can show someone the photo – much easier than describing them.\\nCheck out more, ahem, bright ideas in the\\xa0Tips to keep kids safe when travelling\\xa0 discussion.\\nTurn off mobile 3G/4G and data roaming to avoid shock charges\\nRules introduced in 2017 mean the cost of using your mobile phone in most parts of Europe has been slashed.\\nThis means when making calls or sending texts to anywhere in the EU, or using data in one of those countries, you use your UK allowance (or pay-as-you-go rates) as you would at home, subject to \\'fair usage\\' rules. See our\\xa010 things you need to know about \\'free\\' EU mobile roaming\\xa0news story for full info.\\nThese rules will continue to apply until the date we leave the EU – so you can use your mobile in Europe without incurring roaming fees until then. See our Brexit need-to-knows for more information.\\nOutside the EU, providers are free to charge what they like – some as much as £8/MB – so if you\\'re not careful, using the web abroad could rack up an eye-watering bill.\\nThe most sensible plan is to turn your phone off completely (or put it in \\'airplane\\' mode) while you\\'re on holiday abroad. If you can\\'t, there are ways to slash costs, including data-roaming add-ons, free Wi-Fi hotspots abroad, and even switching your Sim. See the\\xa0Cheap Mobile and Data Roaming\\xa0guide.\\nCheck if you need a visa\\nMany non-EU countries require you to have certain documents in place or to meet other stipulations before allowing you in. Depending on where you\\'re travelling, you may need a visa (basically a certificate giving you permission to enter a country, which also dictates how long you can stay).\\nSome countries offer visas on arrival, others require visas in advance – sometimes a costly and lengthy process. If you\\'re heading to the USA, you may be eligible for the \\'ESTA\\' visa-waiver scheme – though you\\'ll still need to pay and hold a \\'chipped\\' passport. For more, read our\\xa0ESTA guide.\\nThe most reliable way of checking entry requirements for your intended destination is to go to the\\xa0foreign travel advice\\xa0section of the Foreign Office\\'s website, search for the country or territory you want to visit (225 are covered, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe), click through, then click on \\'Entry requirements\\' to find out everything you need to know.\\nWill I need a visa to travel in the EU after Brexit?\\nThe Government says it has an agreement that means UK citizens should be able to travel around EU countries as they can now – without a visa\\xa0– from the day we leave the EU until 31 December 2020. See our 25 Brexit need-to-knows for more info.\\nEnsure your destination is safe\\nBesides keeping yourself out of harm\\'s way, it\\'s also important to check if your destination is considered safe to ensure your holiday is covered. Many travel insurance providers will refuse to pay out for issues – including cancellations – at destinations that have been declared unsafe to visit.\\nTo check entry requirements, destination safety and other information, refer to the\\xa0Government\\'s foreign travel advice.\\nEnsure your passport\\'s valid and in good condition\\nIf you\\'re jetting off, remember to check your passport\\'s expiry date before you book. Some countries demand your passport\\'s valid for at least six months from arrival. Likewise, if your passport\\'s worse for wear, some countries may refuse you entry. Check the\\xa0Government\\'s foreign travel advice\\xa0before you go.\\nRenew your passport in plenty of time and it\\'ll save the hassle and extra cash needed for an urgent trip to the passport office. A standard adult passport is £75.50 if you apply online and can take three weeks to get back. Yet leave this until the very last minute and you risk having to pay £177 for its one-day premium service.\\nTo renew yours, go to\\xa0Gov.uk. Don\\'t just google it – we\\'ve had reports of some being caught out by unofficial websites which charge extra, so always use the official Gov.uk link above to ensure you aren\\'t caught out by a\\xa0copycat site. Full help in\\xa0Passport renewal tips.\\nYou may need to renew your passport earlier after Brexit\\nAt the moment, you can travel to EU countries right up until your passport expires. But if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, you may need to renew it earlier.\\nIf it\\'s older than nine years and six months on the day you travel, you won\\'t be able to travel to certain countries. Use the\\xa0Government\\'s online tool\\xa0to check if your passport will be valid in specific European countries in the event of a no-deal Brexit. See our\\xa025 Brexit need-to-knows\\xa0for more info.\\nPay the right way for extra protection\\nIf your flights or package hols cost over £100, pay by credit card to nab extra protection. This is because when the item\\'s over £100, Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act means the card company\\'s equally liable if owt goes wrong.\\nThis means if the airline goes bust and you\\'ve booked directly with it, you can at least get your money back from the card company. Always pay your card off in full at the end of the month so you\\'re not charged interest. See the full\\xa0Section 75 Refunds\\xa0guide.\\nMore info:\\nWatch out for travel exceptions, including booking via a travel agent\\nBizarrely, if you\\'re booking flights, Section 75 only covers you if each\\xa0individual\\xa0ticket comes to over £100. So if a couple bought two flights at £75 each, even though the transaction would be over £100, they wouldn\\'t be covered. Plus if you aren\\'t the primary cardholder and book your flight on an additional card, you won\\'t be covered.\\nAnother exception\\'s if you buy a flight via a travel agent. Even if over £100, Section 75 doesn\\'t cover you here. Because you pay the travel agent, not the airline, the card company doesn\\'t have a direct relationship with the supplier, so isn\\'t considered liable.\\nDebit card payments get some protection too\\nIf you\\'re paying by debit card, there\\'s also valuable hidden protection that means you may be able to get your money back if something goes wrong. It\\'s called chargeback, and applies to most debit and charge cards, as well as Visa, Mastercard and Amex credit cards – though it isn\\'t a legal requirement. See the\\xa0Chargeback\\xa0guide for info.\\nAvoid hefty fees for checking in at the airport\\nSadly, budget airlines can charge up to an eye-watering £110 per person, per return, just to check in at the airport. So do this free online first. See the\\xa0Beat Budget Airline Charges\\xa0guide for more tricks to avoid check-in fees.\\nGet Our Money Tips Email!\\nFor all the latest deals, guides and loopholes - join the 12m who get it.\\nFAQs\\nPrivacy Policy\\nPast Emails\\nUnsubscribe\\nSlash car hire costs with our tips and tricks\\nHoliday car hire can save a hefty whack on taxis to and from the airport. If you\\'re going to need it (see below for\\xa0alternatives), book the right way to grab it as cheaply as possible.\\nYou can find full details of current deals and tips \\'n\\' tricks in the\\xa0Cheap Car Hire\\xa0guide. Here are the key points:\\nWork out what you need.\\xa0There\\'s often a mass of costly add-ons on offer, including air-con, sat-navs and extra drivers. Before you book, work out what you need and ditch the rest.\\nQuickly compare quotes.\\xa0Next, take the legwork out of your search by using the right comparison sites to grab the most quotes in the least time. Our top picks are Skyscanner*,\\xa0Kayak*, TravelSupermarket* and Carrentals*.\\nCheck for extra discounts.\\xa0See if you can squash the price further via fly-drive package deals, cashback, specialist travel brokers and online vouchers.\\nIt\\'s important to note that if you\\xa0are\\xa0planning on booking a car, you\\'ll need to get a code from the DVLA before you go, but bear in mind it expires after 21 days.\\nUncover secret bargains on 5* hotels\\nThe secret hotel section at\\xa0Lastminute.com*\\xa0has bargains on four and five-star hotels worldwide (including London), because you only know the description and star rating before you pay. This can mean rock-bottom prices for classy establishments.\\nYet often you can cut and paste key phrases into Google to discover which hotel it is. Once you know the hotel\\'s identity, check reviews on\\xa0TripAdvisor*\\xa0and whether it\\'s really a bargain compared to what you can get on the top comparison sites. See our\\xa0Secret Hotels\\xa0guide for how. Some inspiration from MoneySavers:\\nI booked the 5* Grange St. Paul\\'s Hotel in London for £109 (rack rate £215). OH YEAH BABY.\\nI booked the Hilton London Paddington for £69 for a double room. I had a look on the Hilton website and the equivalent cost would be £205 – bargain!\\nDriving abroad? Check if your UK licence is valid\\nA UK driving licence is accepted throughout the EU, but if you\\'re planning a road trip further afield, check if you\\'ll need an International Driving Permit (IDP).\\nAn IDP is required or recommended in about 140 countries, including the USA, Thailand and India. Drive without one where it\\'s needed and you risk trouble with the authorities, and may be refused a hire car.\\nIt\\'s in booklet format and there are two types, known as the 1926 and 1949 Conventions (they\\'re the same price). Which you\\'ll need depends on where you\\'re off to. See the\\xa0Is Your Driving Licence Valid?\\xa0guide for full details.\\nBeware websites selling \\'international driving licences\\' – these aren\\'t legally recognised documents so don\\'t get caught out.\\nYou may need a permit to drive in the EU post-Brexit\\nAt the moment, if you have a UK driving licence you can drive in the EU without any extra documents. Whether that remains the case post-Brexit is likely to depend on whether we strike a deal with the EU.\\xa0See our\\xa025 Brexit need-to-knows\\xa0for more info.\\nBook a cheap package just for the flight\\nScheduled flights to tourist places, such as Orlando and Sri Lanka, can be silly money, yet packages there can sometimes come in much cheaper.\\nIf you only need the flight, check if there\\'s a cheaper package holiday, then grab it but DON\\'T stay in the hotel.\\nMartin once helped a friend book a £300 Sri Lanka holiday for the flight when the cheapest scheduled deal was £1,000+. See the\\xa0Cheap Package Holidays\\xa0guide.\\nCheck if you can save by splitting your ticket\\nIt\\'s easy to search for flights from A to B but don\\'t assume it\\'s the cheapest way. It\\'s commonly associated with trains (see our\\xa0Cheap Train Tickets\\xa0guide) but it can work with flights too, if you\\'re willing to do the research.\\nUse multi-destination options on screen scrapers mentioned above (top picks are\\xa0Kayak*,\\xa0 Skyscanner*\\xa0and\\xa0Momondo*) to see if you can save by flying to one airport and returning from another.\\nOpen-jaw tickets – for example (London Heathrow to Los Angeles and San Francisco to London Heathrow) may be cheaper than bog-standard returns. They can also eliminate the need for backtracking if you plan to visit more than one city. For more flight tricks, see the\\xa0Cheap Flights\\xa0guide.\\nDon\\'t assume a pricier sun lotion is safer – you can get it from as little as £1\\nSun lotion can cost up to a whopping £25 for a 200ml bottle on the high street. Yet it\\'s possible to grab sun lotion for a quid in pound shops. We\\'ve found some great products for a £1 each, when they usually retail at £6-£12. Plus, skin care experts say they check out on skin safety.\\nTry using\\xa0Mysupermarket*\\xa0to quickly compare the price of sun cream in the big supermarkets, plus Boots and Superdrug.\\nThe British Skin Foundation told us: \"When choosing a sunscreen, rather than price or retailer, the two most important factors to look out for are its SPF and UVA rating.\\n\"Firstly SPF, or sun protection factor, is the level of protection sunscreen gives against UVB radiation, the type that causes sunburn. This is usually on the front of the product. We recommend choosing one at SPF 30 or higher.\\n\"Secondly, check the UVA rating, which tends to be on the back. It may be a circle with UVA inside it, or star rating from zero to five. Ideally, aim for four or five stars.\"\\nBeware car hire firms\\' pricey excess insurance\\nIf you\\'re hiring a car, hopefully the closest you\\'ll come to crashing is post-holiday ice-cream withdrawal. But if the worst happens, bear in mind that while there\\'s some cover for hire car damage, there\\'s usually a big problem:\\nCheck the \\'excess\\' – the amount which you\\'ll pay towards any claim. If it\\'s high (£500ish), any scratches or minor damage will be expensive.\\nTo get round this, hire firms try to flog costly excess insurance at pick-up. This is usually a costly extra at about £25 a day, especially with cheap hire companies, as often their profits come from the insurance.\\nYet it\\'s possible to grab cheap excess insurance for less than £2 a day via comparison site\\xa0Money Maxim*. See full\\xa0Cheapest Excess Insurance\\xa0info.\\nHow to SLASH airport parking costs\\nAirports often make more from parking and shopping than planes. Leave the car there without booking first and you risk sky-high rates, so don\\'t just turn up. Booking first, even on the day, could save money.\\nSee the\\xa0Cheap Airport Parking\\xa0guide for the full technique, plus safety tips, how to snaffle hidden local discounts and more.\\nPosh villas and apartments can cost £1,000 less than posh hotels\\nIf you don\\'t fancy battling for a sun-lounger each morning, villas offer space for large groups of friends, or families with kids who need to let off steam.\\nAs a rule of thumb, the larger the group, the bigger the per-person saving, so they\\'re great if there\\'s a party of you going. When we checked, we found a three-bedroom villa in Malaga priced at £352 for a week\\'s stay in mid-August, compared with a nearby hotel costing £1,420.\\nDirect booking sites let you quickly search for holiday rentals. Our top picks are\\xa0HomeAway.co.uk*\\xa0for global reach,\\xa0Clickstay*\\xa0for easy payments and\\xa0 TripAdvisor*\\xa0 for search. Be careful how you pay. You book directly with an owner, so there\\'s less protection. Plus check it\\'s not a fake villa – see\\xa0Cheap Holiday Rentals\\xa0for safety tips.\\nAlternatively, you can rent out whole villas or apartments or just a room in people\\'s homes on\\xa0Airbnb. The idea is hosts put you up in their spare room or rent out their whole home to earn cash on the side. You can stay everywhere from swanky LA lofts to houseboats in Paris, and it\\'s a great way to meet locals.\\nAvoid the \\'perfect trip\\' trap\\nFor many of us, a holiday\\'s an invaluable way to relax and unwind – or gear up and party. Yet before you splash out, remember, the holiday industry is a beacon of commerciality. Travel marketing is honed to make you spend more and more, using emotive language such as \"precious moments\" and \"magical memories\". Don\\'t be sucked in.\\nToo many plan a dream holiday, then only consider later how they\\'ll actually pay for it. That\\'s a sure-fire way to end up disappointed or broke.\\nInstead, ask \"what can I afford to spend?\" then work out how to have the best trip within that budget. A holiday lasts a week or so – don\\'t ruin the rest of the year for it.\\nUse the free\\xa0Budget Planner\\xa0tool to help plan. If you\\'re saving for the trip, the\\xa0Boost Your Income\\xa0guide\\'s crammed with tips to make extra cash.\\nGet local travel info for free before you go\\nIf you plan to explore beyond a trip to the pool, pick your must-sees and transport before you go (see\\xa0Car Hire Alternatives\\xa0below).\\nForget to do this and you risk shelling out on pricey last-minute trips, or ending up stranded at the hotel.\\nFor ideas,\\xa0TripAdvisor*\\xa0has a handy \\'things to do\\' section with reviews of holiday attractions, activities, nightlife\\xa0and shopping. Travel guidebooks can also offer valuable local knowledge on the go. Instead of buying, try your local library.\\nKnow your rights if something goes wrong\\nOur\\xa0Holiday Rights\\xa0guide explains all you need to know about delays, cancellations and more. We hope you won\\'t need it but you may want to bookmark it in case it comes in handy.\\nBag \\'free prints\\' promos for cheap holiday snaps\\nOnce you\\'re back, there\\'s a quick trick to grab massive savings on getting holiday snaps turned into glossy photos.\\nMany photo printing sites offer a set number of free prints to entice new customers. By playing the field, you can use different deals to get loads of holiday snaps printed free, though you\\'ll need to pay delivery. Check out our Free Photo Print deals.\\nGoing outside the EU? Tell your mobile provider\\nTaking your mobile outside the EU can turn it into a cash assassin in some places, costing as much as £3/min to receive a call. The simplest solution is to turn your phone off, but it is possible to cut the cost if that\\'s not a realistic option.\\nMany providers have special packages to use abroad, but unless you call to let them know, you won\\'t get \\'em.\\nThese packages slash the price of calls, and they\\'re the easiest option, though work best if you\\'ll only make a few calls. Some are free, others have a fee, so remember to cancel when you\\'re back. See\\xa0Cheap Mobile and Data Roaming.\\nIf we leave the EU without a deal, the Government says mobile\\xa0users may be liable for roaming surcharges when they travel on the Continent.\\xa0See our\\xa025 Brexit need-to-knows\\xa0for more info.\\nReceiving texts is always free worldwide so get friends to text, not call.\\nDon\\'t get stung by luggage fees on the way back\\nMany people jet home from a holiday with more than they took. Yet if you plan to shop, ensure you leave space in your luggage for the return journey when you pack. Forget to do this and you may be forced to pay extra charges to get it all home, or risk having to ditch your sombreros and straw donkeys at the airport.\\nOff to the US? Beware unofficial ESTA sites\\nEveryone going to the States by air or sea needs to fill out an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) form.\\nApplications cost $14 each, yet beware Googling it. Do this and you may be directed to sites that pretend to be the official web page, and charge an additional fee to process your application. More details in\\xa0Copycat Websites.\\nAlways apply via the official\\xa0ESTA web page. See the\\xa0ESTA guide\\xa0for full info, including renewal help and safety tips.\\nHidden loophole gets up to 60% off posh hotels\\nGiant US site\\xa0Priceline*\\xa0flogs posh hotel rooms at colossal discounts, and it\\'s especially strong for US hotels.\\nOn Martin\\'s own US trip he got even better than 60% off. He got a nice hotel for 63% of the comparison sites\\' cheapest price, but even he was beaten by one MoneySaver who got the Times Square Sheraton for £55/night rather than the listed £200.\\nIt\\'s all about Priceline\\'s \"name your own price\" function, where you pick a city area and star level, name your price and see if any hotels accept it. Of course the aim\\'s to find the minimum acceptable price, so start low, then keep raising your bid till it\\'s accepted – but you can ONLY bid once a day.\\nThere are also techniques to get more bids per day, including bidding with a partner, or adding more areas of a city. See our Secret Hotels guide for full help.\\nMax Avios points for flights \\'n\\' more\\nAvios is the points scheme formed from Air Miles and BA Miles in 2011 – you can use it to grab flights, upgrades and more (you still need to pay taxes and charges).\\nMany mistake it for a frequent flyer scheme. It\\'s actually a points scheme like Nectar and Clubcard, and there are loads of different ways to earn them – in Shell, Tesco and by spending on credit cards.\\nUnlike the old Air Miles system, Avios charges passengers taxes and fees on flights. But it has some benefits over its predecessor. Avios customers can book one-way and \\'open-jaw\\' tickets – eg, London to Vegas, then LA to London – and can use points to upgrade cabin class.\\nWe\\'ve a full list of tips in\\xa0Ways to Boost and Max Avios.\\nAsked to pay in pounds or euros? Say euros\\nMany overseas banks or shops ask this, especially in Spanish tourist resorts. If you choose pounds then the retailer does the currency conversion – rates are often poor compared to letting your card do it (by choosing the local currency), although things are closer than they used to be.\\nIf you\\'ve a top overseas card, always opt for the local currency as your card does the exchange and it\\'s unbeatable.\\nIf you don\\'t, it\\'s touch and go, but it\\'s still safer to go with euros, as the vendor can set its own rate if it wishes, which will usually be worse than the credit card rate.

They all included your flights and a three or four-star hotel.\\nAlthough Weekend.com says it updates prices several times a day, it\\'s worth noting they can change quite quickly if the deals are snapped up. So you may occasionally find the price has risen when you click through.\\nImportant. Weekend.com is fairly new and we don\\'t have much feedback yet, so make sure you double-check all details and the terms and conditions if you do decide to book. If you\\'ve used it, let us know your experiences\\xa0on the forum.\\nQuick questions:\\nHow does it work?\\nWeekend.com sells some package holidays itself, but also offers what it calls \\'Click & Mix\\' hols where it matches flights and hotels (similar to other travel comparison sites),\\xa0and directs you to airlines and booking sites to pay for each separately. It wouldn\\'t tell us how many it searches, but it includes biggies such as Easyjet, Ryanair, Booking.com and Expedia.\\nWhen we looked at 20 deals, we found two were sold by Weekend.com. The rest were \\'Click & Mix\\' deals.\\nBecause the site\\'s all about weekend breaks, your travel days need to include Saturday and Sunday.\\xa0But you can extend your trip a few days either side (between Thu-Tue) if you want to take a long weekend.\\nYou can select specific dates, but to find the very cheapest deals, choose \\'next six months\\' or \\'next six weeks\\' and sort the results by price.\\nYou can also filter trips by flight times, so if you work a traditional 9 to 5 job, you could look for flights leaving on a Friday evening and returning on a Sunday.\\nHow to find a cheap break\\nOnce you\\'ve selected a departure airport, the days you want to travel and how many are in your group (up to four travellers), you\\'ll then be shown a selection of destinations and given more options to filter your results.\\nIf you spot a deal you like, you can click \\'view offers\\' and you\\'ll be shown more details about the hotel and flights.\\nIf it\\'s a \\'Click & Mix\\' deal\\xa0you\\'ll be directed to book the exact hotel/flights on the external sites, so you may need to make bookings on two separate sites.\\nIf it\\'s a Weekend.com package deal\\xa0you\\'ll be asked to enter the travellers\\' details and payment details (it accepts Amex, Visa and Mastercard credit cards). A 20% deposit will be taken at the time of booking, and the remainder will be taken 30 days before your trip. Once your balance has been paid, you\\'ll be sent your airline tickets and hotel check-in details.\\nAlways compare prices before you book\\nOf course, don\\'t assume trips are cheapest on Weekend.com. Always do your own checks and use a comparison site to see if you can find it cheaper.

Package holidays get\\xa0financial\\xa0protection (so you\\'re entitled to a refund or to be brought home if necessary if the firm organising your package goes bust) AND\\xa0legal\\xa0protection (so you\\'re covered if you don\\'t get the holiday you paid for, eg, your hotel is overbooked or promised facilities are missing).\\nSee our Holiday Rights guide for full info.\\nBooked a \\'Click & Mix\\' deal?\\xa0If there\\'s a problem you\\'ll need to contact the firm you have paid for the booking.\\nIt\\'s worth noting if you\\'re delayed by more than three hours or your flight\\'s cancelled, you\\'re often entitled to £110-£520 in compensation. See our Flight Delays guide for full info.\\nFor more help, see our full Holiday Rights guide.\\nTry hostels for cheap accommodation\\nDon\\'t think hostels automatically mean dorm bunks. Many offer singles, twins and doubles, and they can offer massive savings over hotel prices.\\nWhile a few may be squalid, many are clean and friendly, even offering free internet access and breakfast. In the UK,\\xa0Youth Hostel Association\\xa0(YHA) and\\xa0Hostelling Scotland\\xa0properties include fabulous castles and mansions.\\nTo check out prices and availability, use\\xa0Hostelbookers.com*\\xa0and\\xa0Hostelworld*, both of which give hostels a percentage rating based on visitors\\' experiences. To read more reviews from past hostel guests and compare prices, try\\xa0Hostelz.com.\\nMake your own travel-size toiletries\\nTravel-size lotions and potions can be pricey. Retailers know they\\'re convenience goods and charge accordingly – but you don\\'t have to pay through the nose to smell like a rose.\\nWhen we checked, a 75ml travel size Sanctuary body lotion was £2.50 in Boots (£3.33 per 100ml). Yet the full-size version worked out at £2.60 per 100ml, around 20% cheaper if you\\'d buy a full bottle anyway.\\nSo instead of buying pricey travel size versions, grab some small clean empty bottles, and fill \\'em up from your everyday toiletries (this is where complimentary mini-toiletry bottles from previous hotel stays come in handy).\\nDriving in Europe? Check insurance, breakdown, equipment and road rules\\nIt\\'s easy to get caught up in the excitement of planning an overseas road trip, yet forget these tips and your dream drive may look more like a\\xa0Mad Max\\xa0outtake.\\nHere are our top tips:\\nCar insurance.\\xa0Most comprehensive or third party, fire and theft policies become third party outside the UK. They\\'ll pay if you damage another car - or someone else\\'s property - but not your own, and there\\'s no cover if your car\\'s stolen abroad.\\nYou may need to notify your insurer of your trip, so check your policy or call to confirm, and to see if you need a \\'green card\\'. See\\xa0Cheap Car Insurance.\\nBreakdown cover.\\xa0Go outside the UK and often your breakdown cover isn\\'t valid. Check and if it\\'s not, you can either upgrade to a European policy or buy special one-off temporary cover. See\\xa0Cheap Breakdown Cover.\\nDriving rules and requirements.\\xa0Check country-by-country driving regulations in our Driving in Europe guide\\xa0to ensure you\\'re familiar with local rules and equipment you\\'re required to carry before you go.\\nDo a maintenance check.\\xa0Do all maintenance before you go, and ensure you\\'ve got manuals and the numbers to call if your vehicle breaks down.\\nDon\\'t waste cash on energy while you\\'re away\\nDon\\'t just turn off the biggies like lighting and heating before a big trip – also ensure you remember to turn off any TVs and gadgets on standby too.\\nMany devices draw power when plugged in and not in use, so turn switches off at the wall if you can. It\\'s also worth noting in winter you\\'ll still need water to go through pipes at a minimal temperature, or you risk burst pipes. See the\\xa0Energy Mythbusting\\xa0guide for more tips.\\nCompare travel meds prices to get \\'em for less\\nIf you\\'re jetting abroad, ensure you\\'re vaccinated against any nasties before you go. Your local GP\\xa0will offer some vaccinations for free, but others can cost around £50. Some even require more than one dose, meaning costs shoot up quickly.\\nThe NHS\\xa0Fit For Travel\\xa0site has a handy country-by-country guide, while the main\\xa0NHS website\\xa0lists which vaccinations are free and which cost.\\nIf you need to pay for travel meds, NHS prescription prices are fixed, but pharmacies can set their own for private prescriptions. These are given when you want a drug not covered by the NHS in your region, such as Malarone, which prevents malaria.\\nSee our\\xa0Medicine Savings\\xa0guide for more ways to save.\\nCheck big excursion ticket prices before you go\\nWhether it\\'s Disney, Universal Studios, a balloon trip or an aqua park, search early doors to see if there are web vouchers or cheap tickets. Specialist ticket agents can undercut buying direct, so use the theme park\\'s own prices as a benchmark to beat.\\nFor full details see our\\xa0Cheap Disney Tickets\\xa0guide.\\nUse a free app to keep track of your travel plans\\nIf you\\'re planning a big trip, don\\'t just let a mass of disorganised booking confirmation emails pile up.\\nDownload the handy smartphone app\\xa0TripIt\\xa0– available free on\\xa0iTunes\\xa0and\\xa0Google Play. Simply forward all your confirmation emails to it and it\\'ll automatically sort them into a smart itinerary. You can also try\\xa0Remember The Milk\\xa0– free on\\xa0iPhone,\\xa0Android\\xa0and\\xa0Blackberry\\xa0– which helps organise travel to-do lists.\\nOther tips:\\nCreate a separate folder for crucial booking info\\nAn easy trick to keep on top of travel booking details is to set up a separate folder in your email inbox with a memorable title, eg, \"Thailand 2019\". Move booking confirmation emails in as soon as they arrive. Give it a quick check before you leave to make sure you\\'ve got all the key info.\\nPrint essential docs before you go\\nSome bookings will need printouts on arrival, such as airport transfer vouchers. Forget these and you risk having to pay to use printing facilities at the airport, or face problems on arrival. So print them in good time and store them safely with your passport.\\nNab cheap France day returns for under £25\\nIf you\\'re hopping across the Channel, it\\'s often possible to get super-cheap day returns for under £25, sometimes even with a free case of wine thrown in. You can even swap £5 in Tesco Clubcard vouchers for £15 in\\xa0Eurotunnel*\\xa0vouchers.\\nDriving in Europe? Check if you need a sticker to avoid a £70+ fine\\nDepending on where you\\'re planning to drive in Europe, you may need to display an emissions sticker or badge on your windscreen.\\nSeveral countries on the Continent require you to do this to drive through certain cities at certain times in order to curb pollution. If you have an older car it could be banned altogether at certain times. See our Driving in Europe guide for more info.\\nConsider car hire alternatives\\nBefore you book car hire for your hols, don\\'t forget to consider the alternatives. Unnecessary car hire can be an expensive, unused hindrance.\\nCar swaps, public transport and even taking your own car may work out cheaper for some destinations. Go through this checklist first:\\nLook into public transport.\\xa0In Florida or LA, many will need a car for the huge city distances. But in New York you can\\'t park anywhere, so the subway wins. Many European cities have great public transport, so always check.\\nCheck taxi prices.\\xa0If you plan to spend most of your time topping up your tan rather than travelling, a few taxi rides may be cheaper. International taxi fare calculator\\xa0TaxiFareFinder\\xa0gives an estimate of what journeys might cost.\\nTake your own car.\\xa0If venturing onto Europe\\'s roads, it may be possible to take your own car. All UK car insurance policies automatically provide the correct minimum cover required by law in all EU countries, but check if the full cover extends to Europe, and too see if you need a \\'green card\\'. Full info in Cheap Car Insurance.\\nDON\\'T accidentally invalidate your travel insurance\\nHolidaymakers rely on travel insurance for complete peace of mind but if you fail to comply with the T&Cs you could be in for a nasty shock. Did you know something as simple as having a few drinks or leaving your luggage in the hotel storage room could invalidate a claim? And there are plenty of other common holiday habits that could do the same.\\nSee MSE Tony\\'s blog:\\xa08 things many of us do on holiday that could invalidate our insurance.\\nAdd your travel tips on the forum\\nThe\\xa0Overseas Holidays and Travel Planning\\xa0forum board is a great place to share your travel experiences with others.

Chances are, if you buy that new food on offer your kitty won't eat it – but what if you could try it free? I asked my cat MSE Pudding to test some Meow-neySavingExpert tips, including free cat treats, food, and coupons, and we're listing her\\xa0purr-furred options below.\\n‘Free’ cat treats or food minis inside packs\\nIn the last few months, we’ve spotted these special promotional packs in supermarkets such as Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco as well as discounters B&M and Home Bargains, so it really is worth checking a few boxes from the brand your lovable furball prefers. Often, these packs will not only contain a free sample of a treat or food, but also a coupon for money off. We’ve seen between 30p and £1 off cat food, treats and cat gravy (whatever that is).\\nSo if you want to be left\\xa0feline\\xa0fine, the next time you peruse the supermarket shelves, check pet food boxes and bags of cat litter for special stickers on the outside of the packaging. You're typically looking for a small 2cm-ish square or circular sticker saying something like 'Free sample inside' (see examples below).\\nWhat we found and where we found it\\nWe took a look in some of the main supermarkets as well as Pets at Home, Wilko, B&M Bargains and Home Bargains to see if these offers are still widely available, and here's what we found. When we bought the Whiskas and Sheba boxes, we also found coupons inside for the products - usually at least 50p off. Every store we checked had at least one promotional box on the shelves, but obviously it's subject to stock.\\nSupermarket\\nCat food\\nFreebie\\nSainsbury's\\nWhiskas 1+ fish selection\\nWhiskas casserole pouch\\nSainsbury's\\nWhiskas 1+ fish & meaty selection\\nDreamies cat treat sample\\nSainsbury's\\nIams Delights senior 7+ with chicken\\n£2 off Iams proactive health coupon\\nPets at Home\\nWhiskas 1+ fish OR poultry selection\\nDreamies cat treat sample\\nPets at Home\\nSheba fine flakes poultry OR fish selection OR select slices in gravy OR 'Succulent Collection'\\nSheba creamy snacks\\nPets at Home\\nPerfect Fit Junior <1 chicken\\nFirst pack free via cashback\\nWilko\\nWhiskas 1+ fish OR poultry selection\\nWhiskas casserole pouch\\nHome Bargains\\nSheba fine flakes poultry\\nSheba creamy snacks\\nHome Bargains\\nWhiskas 1+ fish selection\\nDreamies cat treat sample\\nTesco\\nWhiskas 1+\\xa0 meaty selection\\nDreamies cat treat sample\\nB&M Bargains\\nSheba fine flakes poultry\\nDreamies cat treat sample\\nB&M Bargains\\nSheba fine flakes 'Succulent Collection'\\nSheba fresh choice pouch\\nB&M Bargains\\nCatsan 10L hygiene clumping litter\\nPerfect Fit dry food sample\\nAsda\\nWhiskas 1+ fish selection\\nWhiskas casserole pouch\\nCoupons for pet food, treats, etc\\nDid you know we have a special pets section in our\\xa0100+ Supermarket Coupons\\xa0page? You’ll usually find freebies and coupons off supplies for cats, dogs and sometimes other pets, often from big brands like Purina.\\nWhen you sign up to the\\xa0free\\xa0Pets at Home\\xa0‘VIP club’ loyalty card, you may get coupons in the post, examples we've seen have included £1 off food or £3 off a £30 spend.\\nDon’t forget, you can usually stack these coupons with other coupons, for example – if you buy £30 of cat food you could use a £3 off £30 coupon as well as £1 off food from Pets at Home and, eg, £1 off Whiskas coupon or similar from another brand, bringing your total saving to £5 off.\\nThe Pets at Home loyalty card also accumulates points which you can choose to donate to help an animal charity, and you can also pick up a free copy of its magazine – which often has more coupons in the back.\\nYou may have been familiar with the sadly now-closed Felix club, where you saved up tokens to exchange for free gifts for your pet, or the Whiskas offer where you bought two packs to claim a free bowl (MSE Pudding still loves hers) so it's worth looking out for similar offers in the future.\\nOther Meow-neySaving tips\\nWe’re not\\xa0kitten\\xa0you, there are more ways to save… but they might leave you in the doghouse. While your cat may love a brand-named food, you yourself are probably eating supermarket own-brand and not noticing the difference, so you could try the\\xa0Downshift Challenge\\xa0with pet food and buy a cheaper brand or supermarket own-label instead.\\nWe know this might not be popular with every diva dog or cat, so it’s probably not worth buying that new 20kg bag of dried food straight away, especially if Mittens is a picky eater, and do follow on-pack recommendations for introducing new food to avoid any upset (or puke between your toes at 5am).\\nHowever, if you do find a food your picky pooch or critical cat will eat willingly, buying that 20kg bag could help trim your pet’s food bill as buying in bulk is normally cheaper. Just make sure the bag you buy has a resealable opening, or you have a resealable container big enough to keep the food in and strong enough to keep your pet out!\\nHow do YOU save money on pet supplies?

You could select by country, sector and ad format to create your own benchmarks.\\nUnfortunately, Google had not been updating this for several months and have now removed it completely.\\xa0 So now we can only present previous data.\\n1. Overall Display Ad CTRs\\nAcross all ad formats and placements display ad CTR is just 0.05%\\nSo, this is just than 5 clicks per 10000 impressions showing the difficulty of driving direct response from online display or banner ads. Perhaps that is why Google no longer publishes this data.\\nWhile this is a really low CTR, however you look at it, cross media optimisation research\\xa0we have seen show that online ads do help increase brand awareness and purchase intent, particularly when combined with offline media. It's not the case that the majority of ad viewers have 'banner blindness' and are not aware of ads which are viewable placements. If this were the case, businesses wouldn't invest in the level of display and programmatic ads that they do.\\nTests from the likes of Dynamic Logic and Millward Brown conclusively show that display ads also encourage site visits (viewthroughs) and searches even where people don't click on ads.\\nWe also see much higher CTRs online for other online ad formats like Google AdWords and Facebook - these can exceed 1%, so are more effective in driving volume and also typically have higher intent, so conversion rates are higher.\\nGoogle Ads (formerly AdWords) display network clickthrough rates by sector\\nThis 2018 cross-industry Google Ads clickthrough rate and conversion benchmark from Wordstream gives data comparing Google Ads CTRs for the search results against Google Ads display ad network which is typically an image or text-based banner format.\\nThe average click-through rate in Google Ads across all industries is 3.17% on the search network and 0.46% on the display network.\\nIt's no surprise that the CTR on the search network is much higher than in the display network since in the search network, searchers are typing in product and brand names when they have specific intent so the ads are more relevant. This isn't the case in the display network where they are responding to banner and text ads, typically on publisher sites.\\nHere are the results from twenty different industries which could be useful if you are a startup modelling conversion rates as part of a business plan, or if you want a top-level comparison for your activities with others in your industry.\\nOf course, the outcome that is measured as conversion rate will vary according to sector and depending on the type of keyword. Brand searches always have higher clickthrough and conversion rates than generic searches, for example. For retail, the outcome will be conversion to sale, but in many other sectors show, the conversion will be conversion to lead.\\n2. Rich media CTRs\\nRich media\\xa0Ad average CTRs are 0.1%\\nThis data from the now defunct Google Display benchmarking tool shows that across standard and rich media, there is an average ad clickthrough rate of 0.14% which is more realistic estimate if ads will be placed on the fold. For Smart Insights advertisers we offered an MPU in the right sidebar above-the-fold and this has a typical CTR of 0.15 to 0.22% depending on the creative and content asset on offer.\\n3. Ad CTR trends\\nThis chart, also from Google-Doubleclick shows that the 0.1% CTR has been an average for some time although the recent fluctuations cast doubt on the data accuracy.\\nFor anyone researching trends in display advertising in different countries or sectors you could try the Doubleclick Ad Research page\\xa0- these reports don't tend to be updated so frequently though.\\nSocial media ad clickthrough rates - a comparison of Facebook and Twitter CTRs\\nRecent changes in Facebook CTRs from a\\xa0Nanigans Q1 2018 Facebook advertising benchmarks show response rates moving upward for ecommerce marketers even after increasing in Q4. The average Q1 2018 CTR of 2.98% in Q1 is 25% higher quarter-over-quarter and 61% higher year- over-year. This is at a similar cost of $10.24 CPM, a quarterly decrease of 2%. Average CPCs are $0.34 in retail.\\nFurther breakdowns aren't given for ad type.\\nWordstream have posted an interesting analysis comparing Facebook and Twitter. It's generally known that Facebook has low CTRs because ad units are not that prominent - it's similar with LinkedIn. Although this is changing as more prominent ad units are created, particularly on mobile.\\nYou can read the full analysis from Larry Kim on Facebook vs Twitter CTRs on Wordstream which includes a wider analysis of the importance of their advertising including mobile.\\nThere is also newer 2017 research Facebook Ad CTR from WordStream's Facebook advertising customers showing that across sectors clickthrough rates (CTRs) vary from around 0.5% through to 1.6%.\\nPay-per-click or SEM clickthrough rates (e.g. AdWords and Bing)\\nThese statistics are courtesy of the Adobe Digital Index reports, published annually for their customers across 200 billion site visits.\\nOf course, these figures are averages and in reality, CTRs\\xa0tend to be higher for brand searches.\\nWe also have a comparison of Google Clickthrough rates by position.\\n4. Comparison of display, search (AdWords) and social ads CTRs\\nThis comparison of average online media clickthrough rates from Marin is useful for modelling the response of digital media for top-level budgets.\\nFacebook ad clickthrough rates by sector\\nFacebook offers different forms of ad formats with different goals will naturally vary in response as these retail Facebook ads from. You can see that Facebook ad CTRs which may be more highly targeted that display ads have significantly higher CTRs, particularly for Lead generation (i.e. adding subscribers to a retailers email list) and Dynamic Product ads (retargeting visitors who have already visited a site with relevant offers).\\nWordstream also have these summary Facebook ad CTRs by sector:\\nThese Facebook Ad CTRs\\xa0for different types of ad formats are taken from a test run by Smart Insights contributor Marie Page. They show that by using targeting in Facebook it's possible to improve on general Internet ad clickthough rates.\\nThe challenge of online ad viewabililty\\nViewability is another issue for advertisers to consider when evaluating online ad effectiveness as measured by clickthrough rates. Ad blocking also has an impact\\xa0since ad blockers have increased in popularity across countries and demographics, accounting for 35% of ads in some countries.\\nViewability refers to the percentage of ads in a campaign or on a publisher site that are potentially available for clickthrough. Just 44.9% of all ads are clickable according to Google-published viewability data\\xa0since ads may be below the fold and users do not scroll to see them. This varies across publisher and content category.\\nGiven the impact of viewability and ad blocking on online ad clickthrough rates you can see that there are moves in the industry to only charge for viewable ads, which with increasing options for native advertising will potentially improve the effectiveness of ads.\\nVariation in online ad clickthrough rates by country\\nThis is historic data for reference - for the latest use the interactive Display benchmarking tool.\\nRegion\\nOverall Click-through Rate Percent (%)\\nNorth America\\nCanada\\n0.09%\\nUnited States\\n0.10%\\nEMEA\\nAustria\\n0.11%\\nBelgium\\n0.13%\\nDenmark\\n0.12%\\nFinland\\n0.05%\\nFrance\\n0.12%\\nGermany\\n0.11%\\nGreece\\n0.17%\\nIreland\\n0.10%\\nItaly\\n0.10%\\nLuxembourg\\n0.09%\\nNetherlands\\n0.14%\\nNorway\\n0.11%\\nSpain\\n0.12%\\nSweden\\n0.08%\\nSwitzerland\\n0.12%\\nUnited Arab Emirates\\n0.18%\\nUnited Kingdom\\n0.07%\\nJAPAC\\nAustralia\\n0.07%\\nChina\\n0.12%\\nHong Kong\\n0.17%\\nIndia\\n0.18%\\nMalaysia\\n0.30%\\nSingapore\\n0.19%\\nSource: DoubleClick for Advertisers, a cross section of regions, January and December 2009, Published July 2010\\nFor latest data see Doubleclick Display Ad Benchmark Statistics.\\nVariation in online ad Clickthrough Rates by ad format\\nAd clickthrough rate naturally varies according to placement (position on screen) and ad format (shape and size).
